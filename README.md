PasswordPusher is an opensource application to communicate passwords over the web. Links to passwords expire after a certain number of views and/or time has passed. 

Hosted at [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com) but you can also easily run your own instance internally on Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift or on Heroku with just a few steps.

I previously posted this project on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/pfda0/do_you_email_out_passwords_i_wrote_this_utility/) which provided some great feedback - most of which has been implemented.

## Deploy in Containers

PasswordPusher can be deployed to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [OpenShift](https://openshift.com/) or any [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) host.

See the [containerization directory](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/tree/master/containerization) for details.  Docker images hosted in [docker.io/r/pglombardo](https://hub.docker.com/r/pglombardo/).

## Deploy Manually

Make sure you have git and Ruby installed and then:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:pglombardo/PasswordPusher.git
cd PasswordPusher
gem install bundler
bundle install --without development production test --deployment
bundle exec rake assets:precompile
RAILS_ENV=private bundle exec rake db:setup
foreman start internalweb
```

Then view the site @ [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).

_Note: You can change the listening port by modifying the
[Procfile](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/blob/master/Procfile#L2)_

### Troubleshooting

#### Command not found: bundle

If you get something like `Command not found: bundle`, then you need to run

    gem install bundler

_If you get something like 'Command not found: gem', then you need to install Ruby. :)_

#### SQLite3

If the 'bundle install' fails with 'checking for sqlite3.h... no', you have to install the sqlite3 packages for your operating system.  For Ubuntu, the command is:

```sh
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 ruby-sqlite3 libsqlite3-ruby libsqlite3-dev
```

### Tip

With the internal deploy process described above, SQLite3 is provided by default for a quick and easy setup of the application.

If you plan to use PasswordPusher internally at your organization and expect to have multiple users concurrently creating passwords, it's advised to move away from SQLite3 as it doesn't support write concurrency and errors will occur.  

For example, on [https://pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com), I run the application with a Postgres database.
